<h1> <a href="http://www.jorgelorenzo.com">Jorge Lorenzo</a> </h1>

<h3>* 2017 - To <a href="index2.html">Ducati</a></h3>


<h4>How long do we have to wait to see Jorge Lorenzo writing a new chapter in Ducati’s history?</h4>

<p>Even if we may look “slow,” it can happen that next year we start with the right foot and win the title.<br>
    This year, the championship is crazy.
    Look at Jonas Folger: In one race, he is almost last, and the following round he fights for the win.</p>

<h4>Where do you see yourself in 10 years?</h4>

<p>I won’t be here making interviews. I want to discover life, visit the world, taste the cuisine of different traditions. <br>
    I’m a discipline and training freak, and when I will stop racing I want to release all the pressure. <br>
    Now I’m 100 percent focused on my job. <br> When I quit, I am lucky to be able to live without working and
    I can do all the things I didn’t have time to do when I was a rider.</p>

<h3>* 2015 - World Champion</h3>


<h4>His thoughts on #TheGrandFinale:</h4>

<p>      “Before coming to Valencia I said to my team on Whatsapp “Ok guys, we have to make the best weekend in our lives,” and that’s what we did.
    <br> I don’t think in the past I have experienced a more difficult or tense situation, with more pressure than I had. I imagined that Valentino
    <br> was going to finish fourth, so I knew that if Marc or Dani, or both, overtook me I’m going to lose the Championship.
    <br> So I was praying, “No please, this time don’t try anything”. But I didn’t know that they also have a lot of problems in the front tyre and
    <br> we won the race, winning the Championship in the last moment. So to have a more emotional, or more dramatic end to the Championship was impossible.”

    <br> <br> “I never cried on the bike, in all my life, but this time was special because I knew how many sacrifices and how much I suffered to get it done.
    <br> When I finished I realise what was going in: where I was or what happened. But every hour that passed I realised that it had been a great
    <br> Championship, a very hard Championship, one that was very hard to get and finally we did it. Sometimes it seems almost impossible, but we never
    <br> gave up and we tried everything and finally the effort was worth it.

    <br> <br> “When you lose a Championship that you know, you felt that you could win, and finally you lose it in the last moment, you think to yourself that
    <br> you deserve the title even though you didn’t win. But this happens in all the sports. The only thing that I can say to my favour is that I was the rider
    <br> with the most victories, five pole positions, two hundred and seventy something laps spent leading the race, compared to just fifty from Valentino, and
    <br> much more practice session leading, in first position and then we arrived in Valencia and we made the pole position, the fastest lap of the race
    <br> and we won the race, so to do anything more to demonstrate that you deserve the world title is difficult.”</p>
